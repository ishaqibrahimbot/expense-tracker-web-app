I am yet to implement log out functionality, so if you want to log out from your account, follow these steps:
* Open the Chrome Dev Tools and switch to the 'Application' tab
* Check the Local Storage and delete the 'token' variable stored there
* Refresh the page

After that, you can sign up or login once again.

There is a bug in the pagination control for the expense table. Something weird happens every time to click the right or left arrow to visit the next page. I will soon fix this bug.
