Okay so right now we have a basic app that is mildly responsive, i.e. adapts to the mobile screen. The only problem there yet to be fixed is that
all the columns of the table do not appear on the screen. One possible solution to that is to remove the checkbox column altogether and see what happens.
Other than that, I still need to learn how to incorporate the responsiveness via React. So here is a list of to-do items based on the above analysis:

1) Test: remove the checkbox column and see if that allows all remaining columns to appear on mobile screen. (note: It's best to do this using the responsive
way so as to not lose the code for the checkboxes altogether. So I will have to incorporate the responsiveness with this)
2) Correction: Change all widths, paddings, and margins to percentages since that is the foundation of responsive design (this might fix the above problem as well)
3) Finalize the responsive design such that we have a good view for desktop and a good view for mobile.

Next, we move on to incorporating 'Users'. The general idea is that a person should be able to login and access their own list of expenses. For this, I will need:

- A login/register page that redirects to the app. Here, it would be essential to remember sessions and keep a user logged in on the same device. Passport should be
able to help with this.

As for the database, there are two ways to go about it:

1) Have a master table for all expenses from all users, but an additional column which carries the name of the user who made that expense. This particular
entry can then be linked to another table that stores the name and details of all the users we have registered with us. This would prevent duplication of 
tables for each user and simplify the design of the database. One table for expenses, one for users, and both are cross-referenced.

Note that this does run into a potential problem. I have set the categories based on my own preferences. Different users may want to keep different categories.
I would have to build a separate functionality to let users edit the categories they wish to keep. The best way to do this would probably be to give a few basic
categories like 'groceries', 'food', 'transport', 'miscellaneous', and 'bills', and then let users add their own categories straight from the drop-down list.
On the database side, this would need a new table for all the categories. Each category would have to be linked to an individual user who created it.

Maybe, a better approach for this would be to have a separate table for the custom categories of each user. This would simplify addition and deletion of
categories by individual users. Yes this is how to proceed. So you supply a basic table of categories, and let the user add or delete categories straight from the
dropdown menu.

Actually, scratch the (2) that is supposed to follow about the ways to go about the database. I'm going with everything I've described above. Here is a list of to-do's
for this:

1) Make a skeleton for the login/registration page.
2) Study how passport works and incorporate login. Breaking this down further:
	- A new table created for users, and every time someone registers a new user is added to that table
	- Every time a new user is added, a new table with the basic categories only is created (only basic for the time being)
	- A search query gathers all the expenses from the expenses table tagged for this particular user logged in and returns it
	- Login state persists until the user logs out manually. (figure out how to do this using passport)
3) Add functionality to add/delete categories. This is going to be handled quite simply: just update the categories table for THAT PARTICULAR USER.

I think this is a lot set out. Should probably take a week or more, maybe. Let's start!

Okay so here are the updates:

1) I successfully incorporated media queries in React to remove the checkbox column. However, it did not have the intended effect, i.e. on my mobile screen the last date
column is still outside the screen. The only remaining option for me is to play around with the font size and reduce it. Note that I did run into a problem: I would still
need the 'Select All' checkbox which is in the column headers row. I could not remove that, so I instead repositioned it below the table with a label that identifies its
function. This may seem a bit weird but I'm gonna leave it there for now.

2) Most widths, paddings, etc. were already in percentages, but there are still some left so I should probably fix that. Just go through all the css code and the 
styles created in the React app and do a trial-and-error to fix them.

3) I do generally have a decent view for mobile and desktop, just need to complete (2) and try out the effect of reducing font size in a responsive way.


As for using passport, I think it would be much better to first just clone and go through the example they've provided using a MySQL database before implementing it
in my app. So yeah I'll do that as the next step.
